### 4) [R Language: ggautothemes](https://github.com/lukastay/ggautothemes/blob/master/README.md)

R package built to syncronize different data visualization themes across multiple packages, and allow users to quickly see how their plots will look like. This package uses R sleep functions to create a "slideshow" of sorts, where users can see their custom data visualization in a wide variety of themes. After a user selects a theme, they can output it to a professional grade high quality raster image file.

### 2) [Non Alcohol Fatty Liver Disease - Decision Tree Investigations](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/fatty-liver-decision-tree-investigations)

Showed flaws in dataset for machine learning tools due to lack of healthy data for elderly individuals. Using decision trees, I showed how machine learning tools will make decisions based on false assumptions if there are such problems with the dataset. Also showed how undersampling can solve some problems with imbalanced data.

### 4) [Titanic - Mass Testing Of Machine Learning Estimators](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/titanic-mass-testing-of-estimators-v2)

This project leverages data on characteristics of people who survived the Titanic disaster to predict whether passengers with unknown data survived or did not survive. It mass-tests 20+ classifiers, and then tunes the hyperparamets of the best model. (Bronze metal)

### 5) [ Dermamtology - Diagnosing The Dataset As Inflating Other Users' Machine Learning Scores](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/dermamtology-fixing-inflated-accuracy-scores)

Using decision tree analysis, this journal showed how low in-class variance for any given variable given to machine learning tools can cause inflated accuracy scores. With low in-class variance, a machine learning tool will simply predict a given result based on arbitrary data.

### 6) [ Backwards Selection For Optimal Regression Modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/lukastaylor2/backwards-regression) 

Backwards selection for regression analysis. Backwards selection chooses variables to use in a regression by testing which variables, when left out of a regression, raise the predictability of the model.

### 7) [Diabetes - Classifier Testing And Undersampling](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/diabetes-20-classifiers-97-91-undrsmpl)

This project is about predicting whether a person has diabetes based on factors like gender, age, BMI, and others. first does exploratory data analysis and data visualizations. Then, it performs LASSO, a way of creating models with only the most significant variables. Next, I mass-test many scikit learn classifiers and tune the hyperparameters of the highest scoring classifier. (Bronze metal)

### 8) [ Heat Flux - Hyperparameter Tuning Of Machine Learning Tools](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/heat-flux-miceforest-and-pycaret) 

This project attempts to predict critical heat flux values. First, the project uses feature imputation using Miceforest, which is a way of dealing with missing data by guessing variable values based on similar data with known values. Secondly, it tests 20+ regression techniques to predict heat flux values and tunes hyperparameters for the best regression model.

### 9) [House Prices - Catboost Hyperparameter Tuning For Top Accuracy Rating](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/house-prices-catboost-hyperparameter-tune-12743)

This model uses the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset. For the competition associated with this dataset, we are supposed to predict house prices based on a variety of variables. After some preprocessing of the data, this journal tunes Catboost, a regression model.

### 10) [Pakistan Houses - Testing Many Regressors, Find LGBM Is Best](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/pakistan-houses-many-regressors-lgbm-best)

This project uses housing data from Pakistan to predict housing prices. It finds Light Gradient Boosting Machine to be the most predictive.

### 11) [House Prices - Tensorflow Random Forest Automatic Hyperparameter Tuner](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/house-prices-tensorflow-random-forest-autotuner)

This project uses the previvous housing prices dataset to tune Tensorflow Random Forest models.

### 12) [Non Alcohol Fatty Liver Disease - Mass Classifier Testing And Undersampling](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/fatty-liver-20-classifiers-92-74-undrsmpl) 

This data finds problems for inflated accuracy scores in the Non-alcohol fatty liver disease dataset due to problems with the dataset having much more data for people without the disease than with the disease. Then, it "undersamples" the data, which is where you remove certain parts of the data in order to make a more representative dataset. Finally, it re-evaluates classifier scores using the undersampled data. (Bronze metal)
