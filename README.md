Top Projects:
1) [Visualizing Supermarket Sales With Seaborn](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/visualizing-supermarket-sales-with-seaborn) - Demonstrated strong data visualization skills with supermarket sales data
2) [Fatty Liver - Decision Tree Investigations]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/fatty-liver-decision-tree-investigations)) - Showed flaws in dataset for machine learning tools due to lack of healthy data for the elderly. Using decision trees, I showed how machine learning tools will make decisions based on false assumptions if there are such problems with the dataset. Also showed how undersampling can solve some problems with imbalanced data.
3) [Regression Vaccines And Death Rates]([url](https://github.com/lukastay/Lukas-Taylor-Repository/blob/main/Regression%20Vaccines%20And%20Death%20Rates.ipynb)) - Regression studying the effects of vaccine rates (first dose, booster, and series) on county level death rates
4) [Pythonreader]([url](https://github.com/lukastay/Lukas-Taylor-Repository/blob/main/pythonreader.py)) - This project searches the user's screen for sentences inside a PDF document. If it finds words on your screen that match with words in the PDF document, it will save the relevant page of the PDF document in a seperate file.

Kaggle.com Notebooks:

1) [Titanic - Mass Testing Of Estimators]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/titanic-mass-testing-of-estimators-v2)) - This project uses data on characteristics of people who survived the titanic disaster to predict whether passengers with unknown data survived or did not survive. It mass-tests 20+ classifiers, and then tunes the hyperparamets of the best model.
2) [ Dermamtology - Fixing Inflated Accuracy Scores]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/dermamtology-fixing-inflated-accuracy-scores)) - Using decision tree analysis, this journal showed how low in-class variance for any given variable given to machine learning tools can cause inflated accuracy scores. In other words, say you have a mole that you would like to predict is tumrous. You do so with a data about the mole - shape, size, etc. If, for any given variable, you only have one value for either cancerous or beinine moles, the machine learning tool will fixate on that and will produce a model that is inconsistant with the real world.
3) [Diabetes - 20+ Classifiers - 97%, 91% Undersample]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/diabetes-20-classifiers-97-91-undrsmpl)) - This project is about predicting whether a person has diabetes based on factors like gender, age, BMI, and others. first does exploratory data analysis and data visualizations. Then, it performs LASSO, a way of creating models with only the most significant variables. Next, we mass-test many scikit learn classifiers and tune the hyperparameters of the highest scoring classifier.
4)[ Heat Flux - Miceforest And Pycaret]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/heat-flux-miceforest-and-pycaret)) - This project attempts to predict critical heat flux values. First, the project uses feature imputation using Miceforest, whhich is a complex way of dealing with missing data by considering variables for similar data. Finally, it tests 20+ regression techniques to predict heat flux values and tunes hyperparameters for the best regression model.
5) [House Prices - Catboost Hyperparameter Tune .12743]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/house-prices-catboost-hyperparameter-tune-12743)) - This model uses the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset. For the competition associated with this dataset, we are supposed to predict house prices based on a variety of variables. After some preprocessing of the data, this journal tunes Catboost, a regression model. 
6) [Pakistan Houses - Many Regressors - LGBM Best]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/pakistan-houses-many-regressors-lgbm-best)) - This project uses housing data from Pakistan to predict housing pricees. It finds Light Gradient Boosting Machine to be the most predictive.
7) [House Prices - Tensorflow Random Forest Autotuner]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/house-prices-tensorflow-random-forest-autotuner)) - This project uses the previvous housing prices dataset to tune Tensorflow Random Forest models.
8) [Fatty Liver - 20+ Classifiers - 92%, 74% Undersample]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lukastaylor2/fatty-liver-20-classifiers-92-74-undrsmpl)) - This data finds problems for inflated accuracy scores in the Non-alcohol fatty liver disease dataset due to problems with the dataset having much more data for people without the disease than with the disease. Then, it "undersamples" the data, which is where you remove certain parts of the data in order to make a more representative dataset. Finally, it re-evaluates classifier scores using the undersampled data.
